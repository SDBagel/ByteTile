# ByteTile
WinForms tool for reducing the pains of creating custom tiles for the [u8g2 Arduino display library](https://github.com/olikraus/u8g2).

The tool generates a list of numbers based on the design shown in the editor which can be dropped into an array for use with the u8x8.drawTile() function.
